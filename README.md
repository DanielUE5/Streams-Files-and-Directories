This repository contains my personal solutions to the Streams, Files and Directories Lab from the C# Advanced module at SoftUni (Software University).
These exercises focus on file and directory manipulation using C# — including reading and writing text files, working with binary data, and calculating directory sizes.

Note: Although these tasks are part of my main C# Advanced Repository, they have been placed in a separate GitHub repository because all of them were implemented under a single .csproj skeleton project.

Also: The "Ëxercise" directory will contain another skelet project, which is a more complex continuation of the Fundamentals assignments about Streams Files and Directories.
